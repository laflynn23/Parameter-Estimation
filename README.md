# Parameter-Estimation Group 4
This is a collaborative project by Liam Flynn, Jeslyn Bui, Alyssa Mendoza, Mikel Sanchez, and Liam Kennedy.

Within the **src folder** there is the python files for Experiment, SignalDetection, and SimplifiedThreePL. There is also a bash script to run the test and a init python file to initialize our project code. 

Within the **test folder** there is the python file for test_SimplfiedThreePL and another init python file.

We have used the provided python code for Experiment and SignalDetection from the class repo and used ChatGPT to aid with creating our SimplifiedThreePL and test_SimplfiedThreePL code to meet project requirements.
